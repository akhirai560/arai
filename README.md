# Portfolio Website

This repository contains a portfolio website for a senior frontend developer. The site includes a hero section, an about section, a skills list, projects, and a contact form. A responsive navigation menu and optional dark mode enhance the experience.

To preview the site, open `portfolio/index.html` in a web browser. Use the moon icon in the header to toggle dark mode. On small screens, the hamburger icon reveals the navigation menu.
